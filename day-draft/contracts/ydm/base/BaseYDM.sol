 * @dev Utilization is the fraction of a capital pool's service capacity that is currently in use: the ratio of demand for the service the pool provides to the pool's capacity to supply it, scaled to WAD precision
 * @dev This base holds the per-instance target utilization (the curve's kink) so the same model can be configured to target any utilization a market measures
